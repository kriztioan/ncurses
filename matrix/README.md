# Matrix Rain

`Matrix Rain` displays the streaming computer code featured in the [Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)) series in a terminal. It is written in `C` and uses `ncurses`. `Matrix Rain` was inspired by a One Lone Coder [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA) ([Github](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/), [website](https://community.onelonecoder.com)) and has some similarities with [cmatrix](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix).

## Usage

The program is compiled with:

```shell
make
```

This results in a binary executable called `matrix.bin` in the parent directory, which is invoked as:

```shell
./matrix.bin
```

## Keys

The following keys are recognized:

key|function
---|--------
f|show frame time
p|pause
q|quit

## Notes

1. `The Matrix` glyphs will be displayed when `xterm` is used as the terminal emulator and the `mtx` font from [cmatrix](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix) (included here for convenience) is correctly installed.
2. Dynamic resizing of the terminal window is supported.
