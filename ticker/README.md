## Usage

The program is compiled with:

```shell
make
```

This results in a binary executable called `ticker.bin` in the parent directory, which is invoked, for example, as:

```shell
./ticker.bin rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss
```

The first command line argument is the URL of a [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed.

## Keys

The following keys are recognized:

key|function
---|--------
`F1`|quit
`CTRL-C`|quit

## Notes

1. By default, `Ticker` checks the feed every 1800 seconds.
2. The contents of the input window at the bottom will be passed to an external script on hitting `<return>`. The script can be set via the `script` variable in `main.c`.
