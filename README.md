# Ncurses Projects

A collection of `ncurses` terminal projects written in `C`. Many of these projects were inspired by One Lone Coder [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA) ([Github](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/), [website](https://community.onelonecoder.com)).

## Usage

All projects are compiled simultaneously with:

```shell
make
```

This results in a number of binary executable `.bin` files. See each project's `README.md` for  project details.

## Notes

1. For a 'retro' feel and square pixels, install a `classic text mode font` from [The Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/).
2. Most projects support dynamic resizing of the terminal window.
3. Most projects require `ncurses` wide character support. On MacOS this can require setting the C pre-processor flag `_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED`.
